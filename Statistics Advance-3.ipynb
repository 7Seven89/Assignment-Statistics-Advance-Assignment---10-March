    "\n",
    "**Point Estimate**:\n",
    "- A point estimate is a single value used to estimate a population parameter. For example, the sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean.\n",

    "**Interval Estimate**:\n",
    "- An interval estimate provides a range of values within which the population parameter is expected to lie, with a certain level of confidence. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the mean provides a range where we expect the true population mean to fall 95% of the time."
